The given text is from the Guidelines of CPCSEA for Experimentation on Fishes-2021. The guidelines are intended to provide information on the humane procedures for holding, handling, and sampling fish for experimental, research, or teaching purposes. The guidelines cover various aspects of fish care and use, including the selection of appropriate fish species, housing and environmental conditions, feeding, handling and sampling, anesthesia and euthanasia, and the use of analgesics and anesthetics. The guidelines also provide information on the ethical considerations associated with the use of fish in research and the role of animal ethics committees in reviewing and approving fish research protocols. The guidelines are intended to promote the humane treatment of fish and to ensure that they are used in a responsible and ethical manner in research and teaching.

## To whom the background information will be of use(prompt)

The background information will be of use to the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) and the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) of an institution that conducts experiments on fishes. The information will help them in ensuring that the fish facility is designed and operated in compliance with the guidelines set by the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA), India. The IAEC and IBC can use this information to evaluate the facility's ability to provide adequate care and welfare to the fishes, ensure the safety of the staff and the environment, and maintain proper records. Additionally, the information can also be useful for researchers and fish facility managers to understand the best practices and regulatory requirements for conducting experiments on fishes.
